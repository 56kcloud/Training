## Document conventions

When you encounter a phrase in between `<` and `>`  you are meant to substitute in a different value. 

For instance if you see `ssh <username>@<hostname>` you would actually type something like `ssh labuser@v111node0-adaflds023asdf-23423kjl.appnet.com`

You will be asked to SSH into various nodes. These nodes are referred to as **v111node0**, **v111node1** etc. These tags correspond to the very beginning of the hostnames you will find in your welcome email.
