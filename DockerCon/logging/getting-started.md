## <a name="Task_1"></a>Task 1: Start a container to log

Now that Docker is setup, it's time to get our hands dirty. In this section, you are going to run a variant of NGINX called [jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/traefik/) container (a high-performance webserver, load-balancer, and proxy) on your system and get hands-on with the `docker logs` command.

1. To get started, let's run the following in our terminal:

    ```
    $ docker container run -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine
    Unable to find image 'jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine' locally
    alpine: Pulling from jwilder/nginx-proxy

    Digest: sha256:6181afd7ce4a0291bf73b1787be33928213203401ccbeee2cd720db5d700636b
    Status: Downloaded newer image for jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine
    673f5eed33e6ebea397bb162567a66923f3772c6e409f0de4614467d0f157f93
    
    ```

2. Ensure the `NGINX` container is running

    ```
    $ docker container ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
    ```

    Uh oh, what happend?
    We can actually use the `docker logs` command on stopped containers to troubleshoot. Great, let's do it.

3. Check the logs of the `NGINX` container to see why the container didn't start

    ```
    $ docker logs nginx
    ERROR: you need to share your Docker host socket with a volume at /tmp/docker.sock
    Typically you should run your jwilder/nginx-proxy with: `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro`
    See the documentation at http://git.io/vZaGJ
    WARNING: /etc/nginx/dhparam/dhparam.pem was not found. A pre-generated dhparam.pem will be used for now while a new one
    is being generated in the background.  Once the new dhparam.pem is in place, nginx will be reloaded.
    ```

4. OK, remove the `NGINX` container

    ```
    $ docker container rm -f nginx
    ```

    > This is the forceful way to remove it. With great power comes great responsability. You are warned!

5. Start `NGINX` with the suggestions from the log file

    ```
    $ docker container run  -d -p 8080:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
    --name nginx \
    jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine
    ```

6. Ensure the `NGINX` container is running

    ```
    $ docker container ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
    960ab9aed7af        jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine   "/app/docker-entrypoâ€¦"   3 seconds ago       Up 3 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   nginx
    ```

7. Test the `NGINX` container with `curl` or open a browser tab and navigate to: `https://0.0.0.0:8080` (PWD just click the link provided above the terminal)

    ```
    $ curl 0.0.0.0:8080
    ```

    Go ahead and send a few curl/refresh request to the `NGINX` container.

8. Check the logs

    ```
    $ docker container logs nginx
    ```

    > What do we see different? We should now see the each curl/refresh we sent to the `NGINX` container
    
    
We are still seeing an error in the log file which is `HTTP Error 503` Let's start a container and connect it to the reverse proxy to see if we can get everything healthy.


Now, we will connect a `whoami` container to the NGINX proxy. This whoami container will register itself automatically with the proxy when we pass enviornment variables to the container.

9. Start the `whoami` container 

    `$ docker container run -d -e VIRTUAL_HOST=whoami.local --name whoami jwilder/whoami`
    
    > The `jwilder/nginx-proxy`polls for new containers containing the environment variable `VIRTUAL_HOST` When this variable is seen it       > is automatically registered with the proxy
    
10. Let's check the logs to see if it the `whoami` container registered with the proxy

    ` $ docker container logs nginx`
    
    We should see the whoami ID register with the proxy
    ```
    dockergen.1 | 2018/06/09 21:36:52 Received event start for container d4d73cb5ef99
    dockergen.1 | 2018/06/09 21:36:52 Generated '/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf' from 2 containers
    dockergen.1 | 2018/06/09 21:36:52 Running 'nginx -s reload'
    ```

11. `curl` the whoami container using the Virtual Hostname we created
    
    ```
    $ curl -H "Host: whoami.local" localhost:8080
    I'm d4d73cb5ef99
    ``` 
12. Finally, run the `docker container logs` command on the proxy to ensure everything is now working as expected

    `docker container logs nginx`
    
    > We now see the hostname which is queried and a `HTTP 200` success code


### <a name="Task_2"></a>Task 2: Understanding the Docker Logs Command

The `docker container logs` command is a powerful command and is used for troubleshooting, analyzing, and general information gathering. The command is useful to Developers to debug new applications as well as Operations for information gathering.

1. Great! Let's now take a look at the `docker container logs` help to better understand how we can best use the command

    ```
    $ docker container logs --help

    Usage:  docker logs [OPTIONS] CONTAINER

    Fetch the logs of a container

    Options:
        --details        Show extra details provided to logs
    -f, --follow         Follow log output
        --since string   Show logs since timestamp (e.g. 2013-01-02T13:23:37) or relative (e.g. 42m for 42 minutes)
        --tail string    Number of lines to show from the end of the logs (default "all")
    -t, --timestamps     Show timestamps
        --until string   Show logs before a timestamp (e.g. 2013-01-02T13:23:37) or relative (e.g. 42m for 42 minutes)
    ```

2. Add timestamps to our logging output. This will help with narrowing down when events occured if no timestamp is created in the log message.

    ```
    $ docker container logs -t nginx
    ```

3. Tail the last `n` number of lines in the log file

    This is extremly helpful when logs become very big. If you were to run a `docker logs` command on a large log it could over run your terminal winder


    ```
    $ docker container logs --tail 5 nginx
    ```

4. Follow the log for real-time updates. 
    
    ```
    $ docker container logs -t -f nginx
    ```

    Curl or refresh the URL 0.0.0.0:8080 a couple times to see the log update
    

5. Restart the `NGINX` container

     ```
    $ docker container restart nginx
    ```

6. Check the logs again. What do you notice?

    ```
    $ docker container logs nginx
    ```

    > The logs still persist inside the container from our previous tests.

7. Stop and remove the NGINX container

    ```
    $ docker container rm -f nginx
    ```

8. Start `NGINX` again

    ```
    $ docker run  -d -p 8080:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro \
    --name nginx \
    jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine
    ```

9. Check the logs. What do you notice?

    ```
    $ docker container logs nginx
    ```

    > This time we removed the container and started a new container. It is important to notice now the logs didn't persist. This is why   it is important we persist logs outside of the containers.

10. Cleanup running containers

    `$ docker container rm -f whoami nginx`


### <a name="Task_3"></a>Task 3: docker-compose and logging

We have now seen how logging works in a single container. Now, we want to see what logs look like when multiple containers are running in a compose file. In this example we will use the docker voting application. This stack contains 5 different containers running with one docker-compose file.

1. Clone the Voting App Repo

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app.git
    ```

2. Start the Voting App with docker-compose.

    ```
    $ cd example-voting-app

    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Once the voting application stack has started. Check the logs of the voting app stack.


    ```
    $ docker-compose logs
    ```

    What we notice is that Docker color codes the log based on container names. Since we have 5 different containers this makes it easier when viewing from a terminal window.

4. Expanding the command to capture certain containers

    ```
    $ docker-compose logs |grep vote_1
    ```

5. Open a browser tab `http://0.0.0.0:5000` and place a few votes and watch the logs. 

    > Since no timestamp is in the log it is difficult to see if new votes arrived or not.

6. Combing everything we learned

    ```
    $ docker-compose logs --follow -t |grep vote_1
    ```

    > Again place some more votes on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` and see the difference in the logs

## <a name="Terminology"></a>Recap

What did we learn in this section?

* Running `docker logs` on stopped containers
* Troubleshooting containers
* The `docker logs`command is actually quite powerful and can be combined with other tools like the Linux `grep` command or others
* Logs don't persist in containers once the container is removed
* `docker-compose logs` works similiarly to `docker logs` but displays all containers in the compose stack
