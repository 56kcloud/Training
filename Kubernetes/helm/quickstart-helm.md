# Helm Installation

Helm is the Kubernetes Package manager. Helm allows users to search and share Helm `Charts`. Helm Charts is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex, like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on. More info on [Charts](https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/#charts)
